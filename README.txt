Pikmin 1 BLO text editor by EpochFlame
32-byte alignment by Roeming

Arguments are input BLO, text containing the new string, and output BLO
Example invocation: pik1blo.py vanilla.blo newtext.txt output.blo

The script is rudimentary and is not guaranteed to work with all Pikmin 1 BLOs.

Additionally, this edits the BLOs themselves, not the .bun files containing the BLOs used by the game. 

Place the BLO you want to change in the same folder as the pik1blo.py script.
